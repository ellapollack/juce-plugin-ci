# DEPRECATED (use [Pamplejuce](https://github.com/sudara/pamplejuce) instead)
(June 2023) I am deciding to deprecate this repository because I am now a full-time high school teacher and don't have to time to maintain it anymore. Also because [@sudara's Pamplejuce](https://github.com/sudara/pamplejuce) repository is a much more thorough and up-to-date template for JUCE projects.

---

### [Use this template](https://github.com/maxwellpollack/juce-plugin-ci/generate) to start a new JUCE audio plugin project in a Github repository.

It contains:
1. the boilerplate audio plugin code from [`JUCE/examples/CMake/AudioPlugin`](https://github.com/juce-framework/JUCE/tree/master/examples/CMake/AudioPlugin)
2. a CMake `FetchContent` call to automatically download and link the JUCE library
3. a GitHub Actions workflow which automatically builds (with CMake) and tests (with CTest) the audio plugin for 64-bit MacOS, Windows, and Linux platforms on every push

#### To publish a new Release, tag your commit with a version number before pushing:
```shell
git tag v1.0.0
git push origin main --tags
```
